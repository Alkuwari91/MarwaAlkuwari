    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
  </header>

  <p>This module on Intelligent Agents has been a transformative learning experience that allowed me to engage deeply with both theoretical foundations and practical applications of artificial intelligence. From the early exploration of agent-based computing and logic-based systems to more advanced topics such as deep learning and adaptive algorithms, each week brought new insights and challenges that broadened my understanding of intelligent systems.</p>

  <p>I particularly valued the emphasis on real-world relevance—whether through discussions on agent communication protocols like KQML and KIF, or the ethical complexities of deepfake technologies and AI-generated content. These lessons deepened my critical thinking and highlighted the social responsibilities we must uphold as developers and researchers in this field.</p>

  <p>The team project further amplified this learning by enabling collaborative problem-solving. Our multi-agent fitness monitoring system bridged theoretical knowledge with tangible implementation, reinforcing skills in system architecture, security protocols, and agile development. Working with my peers not only honed my technical and project management skills but also highlighted the importance of effective communication, mutual respect, and adaptability in a team setting.</p>

  <p>Through reflective practice, I’ve become more aware of the competencies I’ve developed: analytical thinking, ethical reasoning, technical fluency, and collaboration. I feel better equipped to apply these skills in academic, professional, and real-world AI scenarios. Moving forward, I aim to continue exploring emerging AI trends, contribute to ethically responsible innovation, and pursue further interdisciplinary research opportunities.</p>

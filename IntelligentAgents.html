    <h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Agent-Based Computing</h2>
  </header>

  <h3><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h3>
  <p>Week 1 explored the trends in computing that have led to the rise of agent-based computing. The concept of an agent was introduced, along with its growing relevance across various sectors and applications.</p>
  <p>The lecturecast focused on the drivers of intelligent computing, emphasizing agent-based approaches. It examined the autonomy of computer programs and their significance in the current technological landscape.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identified the trends that contributed to the growth in agent-based technologies.</li>
    <li>Analyzed the implications of these trends on the broader computing landscape.</li>
    <li>Explored agent-environment interactions and agent-to-agent communication.</li>
    <li>Presented examples of agent-based systems and their applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Key Learning</u></strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed a foundational understanding of agent-based computing concepts.</li>
    <li>Recognized the computing trends that support the agent paradigm.</li>
    <li>Compared different agent-based systems to evaluate their strengths and limitations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Collaborative Discussion 1: Agent Based Systems</u></strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Initial Post by Marwa Alkuwari:</strong> Agent-based systems (ABS) emerged as a solution to the growing complexity of contemporary problems and the shortcomings of centralized approaches. These systems rely on autonomous agents capable of decision-making and interaction, empowered by developments in AI and distributed computing (Wooldridge, 2009). Driving factors include the rise of IoT and cloud technologies, advances in multi-agent systems (Jennings, 1998), and increased demand for real-time adaptability across industries such as logistics, healthcare, and finance. ABS provide benefits like parallel processing, increased resilience, and simulation capabilities that support innovation and strategic decision-making (Bonabeau, 2002).</p>

    <h2>Unit 2: Introducing First Order Logic</h2>
  </header>

  <h3><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h3>
  <p>Week 2 focused on the foundational elements of First Order Logic (FOL), also known as Predicate Logic. The seminar introduced students to the core mathematical structures that underpin intelligent systems and logical reasoning in AI.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Explored key terms and symbols used in first order logic.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated how FOL relates to natural language expressions.</li>
    <li>Discussed the role of universal and existential quantifiers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Key Learning</u></strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Understood core elements such as predicates, constants, variables, functions, and logical connectives.</li>
    <li>Converted natural language statements into formal FOL notation.</li>
    <li>Applied universal (∀) and existential (∃) quantifiers in logical expressions.</li>
    <li>Recognized how FOL supports structured knowledge representation in AI.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Collaborative Discussion 1: Agent Based Systems</u></strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Peer Response by Noora Alboinin:</strong> Noora supported the relevance of ABS in modern AI, emphasizing their role in enabling distributed, flexible, and scalable solutions. She highlighted their ability to simulate complex systems, especially in areas like urban planning and finance (Jennings, 1998). She also addressed the challenges of ethical governance and execution complexity, calling for legal frameworks to ensure responsible deployment (Bonabeau, 2002).</p>

    <h2>Unit 3: Agent Architectures</h2>
  </header>

  <h3><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h3>
  <p>Week 3 focused on the various approaches to designing agent architectures. The lecturecast reviewed the history of agent development and explained how it led to the emergence of different architectural models. It explored symbolic reasoning agents, reactive architectures, and agents with internal states to compare their features and effectiveness.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reviewed the historical development of agent systems and research.</li>
    <li>Evaluated the strengths of multiple architectural frameworks.</li>
    <li>Examined case studies and examples to demonstrate the mechanisms behind each architecture.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Key Learning</u></strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Critically evaluated a variety of agent architectures.</li>
    <li>Selected appropriate architectures based on specific problem requirements.</li>
    <li>Distinguished between agent desires and intentions within architectural designs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Collaborative Discussion 1: Agent Based Systems</u></strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Summary Post by Marwa Alkuwari:</strong> The full discussion revealed that ABS have become essential for addressing the challenges of distributed and dynamic environments. My initial post discussed how ABS offer autonomy and adaptability by leveraging technologies like IoT and advances in MAS. Noora’s response emphasized their strength in modeling complex systems and highlighted ethical and governance challenges. The discussion concluded that strategic implementation of ABS—supported by legal oversight—is key to unlocking their transformative potential in sectors such as logistics and finance (Bonabeau, 2002; Jennings, 1998; Wooldridge, 2009).</p>

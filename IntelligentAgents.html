  <header class="major"><h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Agent-Based Computing</h2></header>
  <p>This unit laid the groundwork for understanding agent-based computing by introducing key ideas and the technological advancements that have accelerated its evolution. We started with the core definition of an agent: an autonomous piece of software that can sense its environment and take actions aligned with its objectives. Because of their autonomy and decision-making capabilities, agents are now widely adopted in various industries.</p>
  <p>The lecturecast highlighted why agent-based systems are gaining popularity. It emphasized three defining traits—autonomy, reactivity, and proactivity—that make agents intelligent and adaptable. These qualities allow them to engage with their surroundings and coordinate with other agents, which is the basis for constructing multi-agent systems.</p>

  <h3>Learning Achievements:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Gained insight into the main ideas behind agent-based computing.</li>
    <li>Identified the major tech developments that led to the spread of agent-based solutions.</li>
    <li>Looked into examples where intelligent agents are applied in real-world contexts.</li>
    <li>Understood how agents can work together, compete, and respond to changing situations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Seminar Overview:</h3>
  <p>In the opening seminar, we covered the module layout, what is expected from students, and the role of agent-based computing in addressing modern-day problems. We also brainstormed early concepts for our group project and discussed using collaborative platforms like Trello or shared files to manage our teamwork.</p>

  <h3>Lecturecast Focus:</h3>
  <p>Introduction to Agent-Based Computing</p>

  <h3>Personal Reflection:</h3>
  <p>This week's content helped me see how agent-based systems offer a shift from classic programming by incorporating independence and responsiveness in software. What stood out to me is how these agents are already at work in areas such as robotics, financial services, and healthcare. I’m eager to apply what I’ve learned through practical assignments and group collaboration.</p>

  <header class="major"><h2>Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2></header>
  <p>This unit introduced us to the fundamental concept of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and its vital role in preparing data for AI and data science applications. EDA serves as a key step in evaluating the quality of raw data, identifying anomalies, and revealing patterns that aren't always immediately obvious. These insights lay the groundwork for building effective and trustworthy models.</p>

  <h3>Learning Highlights:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ensuring Data Integrity:</strong> EDA techniques help detect inconsistencies, missing values, and errors, ensuring that datasets are accurate and reliable before modeling.</li>
    <li><strong>Improving Feature Selection:</strong> Through initial analysis, we learn how to refine or remove irrelevant features, contributing to stronger machine learning performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Interpretation:</strong> Visualization methods, such as histograms and scatter plots, allow us to observe data distributions, outliers, and correlations that influence feature engineering.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Understanding the EDA Process:</h3>
  <p>We explored the step-by-step process of performing EDA, including feature assessment, outlier detection, and creating visual summaries. By the end of this unit, we developed foundational skills to clean and structure data effectively for both supervised and unsupervised learning models, as noted by Miroslav (2021).</p>

  <h3>Seminar Overview:</h3>
  <p>During the seminar, we practiced EDA techniques using real datasets. The session highlighted approaches like univariate and multivariate analysis, equipping us with practical skills to spot unusual data points, identify structure, and prepare data for machine learning pipelines.</p>

          <section id="unit3">
  <header class="major"><h2>Unit 3: Correlation and Regression</h2></header>
  <p>In this unit, I deepened my understanding of how statistical relationships between variables can be identified and modeled using different types of regression. We covered simple, multiple, and polynomial regression, each of which supports the predictive capabilities central to AI and data science. These techniques help us recognize dependencies such as how age, education level, or income might be interlinked.</p>

  <h3>Learning Highlights:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Understanding Relationships:</strong> I developed the ability to measure the strength and direction of relationships between variables using correlation analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> I practiced building linear models to forecast outcomes based on input variables. This process involved identifying when to apply simple versus more complex regression models.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethical and Practical Insight:</strong> We critically reflected on the broader impacts of data-driven predictions—particularly the ethical and legal consequences of using personal or sensitive data in predictive systems. Ensuring fairness, transparency, and inclusiveness in model development became a key discussion point.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Challenges:</strong> We addressed real-world complexities like data diversity, noise, and overfitting, which require careful data preparation and variable selection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Theory into Practice:</h3>
  <p>Regression models form part of intelligent agents' reasoning abilities, akin to how Maes' <em>Agent Network Architecture (ANA)</em> enables autonomous decision-making. Just as modules in ANA compete based on activation energy to influence behavior, variables in a regression model influence predicted outcomes based on their weights. Both processes reflect adaptive systems that evolve with context and input data.</p>

  <p>Drawing inspiration from Maes (1991), regression analysis can be viewed as one layer of reasoning in an intelligent system—supporting the agent’s goal-achieving behavior by identifying relevant patterns. This aligns with the broader concept of agents learning from feedback and adapting over time, as seen in competence modules learning which actions lead to successful outcomes.</p>

  <header class="major"><h2>Unit 4: Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn</h2></header>
  <p>This unit focused on applying linear regression techniques using Python’s Scikit-Learn library. I explored how to model relationships between variables in both simple and multivariate contexts. The learning extended to evaluating model performance using key metrics such as R-squared, allowing for better judgment of prediction accuracy and model reliability.</p>
  
  <p>As datasets grow in complexity, understanding how to optimize models becomes essential. This unit emphasized the practical challenges of modeling real-world data, from selecting meaningful features to adjusting model parameters for improved results.</p>

  <h3>Learning Highlights:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Applying Regression to Complex Datasets:</strong> I developed the ability to model both straightforward and multivariable datasets using linear regression, identifying patterns and trends that support data-driven decision-making.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Evaluation and Optimization:</strong> I practiced refining regression models using evaluation metrics to improve prediction accuracy. Understanding how to tune model parameters was a key takeaway.</li>
    <li><strong>Proficiency in Scikit-Learn:</strong> I enhanced my technical skills in using Scikit-Learn’s regression tools, streamlining the process of model creation, training, and evaluation in real-time scenarios.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Theory in Context:</h3>
  <p>In the context of intelligent systems, predictive modeling plays a vital role in how agents interpret environmental inputs and forecast outcomes. Drawing from Wooldridge (2009), especially Chapter 5, Section 5.2, an agent's ability to make informed predictions aligns with the need for models like linear regression in adaptive decision-making.</p>

  <p>This reflects a larger principle in multiagent systems: intelligent agents must reason with uncertainty and learn from data. Regression analysis provides a foundation for agents to adaptively respond based on predictive insights, whether in simulations, financial systems, or healthcare models.</p>

  <h3>Seminar Summary: Regression with Scikit-Learn</h3>
  <p>In this hands-on seminar, we practiced implementing simple and multiple regression models using Python in Google Colab. We learned how to apply, test, and optimize our models through practical exercises, gaining a deeper understanding of predictive modeling in real applications.</p>

      <h2>Reflective Piece</h2>
      <p><span class="highlight">What:</span> During this module, I gained deep insights into the design and functionality of intelligent agents, including their autonomy, environment interaction, and problem-solving capabilities. My understanding evolved from basic theoretical frameworks to implementing real MAS design in a group setting.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">So What:</span> This knowledge allowed me to reflect critically on agent behavior and system-level dynamics. It strengthened my skills in coordination, delegation, and debugging distributed code. I also improved my ability to assess different agent architectures and choose suitable strategies based on real-world needs.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Now What:</span> I plan to leverage these skills in educational AI toolsâ€”specifically adaptive learning environments and intelligent tutoring systems. This experience gave me confidence in integrating agents into domains like e-learning and consultancy solutions, including platforms such as Rasekhon.</p>

      <h2 id="unit4">Unit 4 Activity: Constituency-Based Parse Tree</h2>
      <p>This activity involves creating constituency-based parse trees to demonstrate how intelligent systems can structurally interpret natural language input. This directly supports agent-environment communication and decision-making processes in multi-agent environments.</p>

      <h2 id="unit10">Unit 10 Activity: Deep Learning for Mental Health Diagnosis</h2>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> One emerging application of deep learning is its use in diagnosing mental health conditions through voice analysis. AI-powered tools can now detect signs of depression, anxiety, or PTSD based on tone, pitch, speech patterns, and hesitation frequency during spoken conversations.</p>

      <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> These systems use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers trained on labeled datasets containing speech samples from both healthy individuals and patients with diagnosed mental conditions. The models learn to identify subtle speech anomalies linked to specific mental states.</p>

      <p><strong>Socio-Technical Impact:</strong> This technology has strong potential for early detection and intervention, particularly in underserved areas. However, it also raises critical concerns around <em>privacy, consent, data sensitivity, and the potential for algorithmic bias</em>. Ethically, there is a risk of over-reliance on machine judgment without proper clinical validation, and socially, it could impact how employers or insurers perceive individuals flagged by such systems.</p>

      <p>This use case bridges intelligent agent research with real-world impact and shows how ethical foresight is essential in deploying deep learning in sensitive domains.</p>

    <h2>Unit 3: Agent Architectures</h2>
  </header>

  <h3><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h3>
  <p>This unit focused on different types of agent architectures including reactive, deliberative, and hybrid models. Each architecture offers unique ways for agents to process information and respond to their environment, balancing between speed, complexity, and learning capabilities.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reactive Agents: Act based on direct stimuli from the environment with no internal state.</li>
    <li>Deliberative Agents: Use internal models and planning to select actions.</li>
    <li>Hybrid Agents: Combine reactive and deliberative layers for flexible decision-making.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Unit 4: Hybrid Agent Architectures</h2>
  </header>

  <h3><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h3>

    <h2>Unit 5: Agent Communication</h2>
  </header>

  <h3><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h3>
  <p>This unit focused on how agents communicate using formal languages and protocols. Key topics included Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) and the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) standards. We explored how structured communication enables agents to coordinate, negotiate, and share knowledge.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Introduced key agent communication languages: KQML and FIPA ACL.</li>
    <li>Explored performatives and illocutionary acts in message exchange.</li>
    <li>Discussed ontologies and their role in mutual understanding between agents.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Key Learning</u></strong></h3>

    <li>Understood the role of standardized communication in multi-agent systems.</li>
    <li>Analyzed sample agent dialogues using performatives such as inform, request, and propose.</li>
    <li>Evaluated benefits and limitations of agent communication protocols.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Collaborative Discussion 2: KQML vs Method Invocation</u></strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Initial Post by Marwa Alkuwari:</strong> I discussed the advantages of KQML in facilitating semantic communication between autonomous agents, particularly its ability to express intent. While method invocation is more direct and faster, KQML supports reasoning and contextual understanding, essential for open agent environments. Challenges include the need for shared ontologies and parsing complexity.</p>

  <p><strong>Peer Response:</strong> Rodrigo supported the argument by highlighting how KQML enables dynamic knowledge exchange and supported reasoning mechanisms, despite being harder to implement than traditional function calls.</p>

    <h2>Unit 10: Deep Learning in Action</h2>
  </header>

  <h3><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h3>
  <p>Week 10 expanded on the foundational understanding of Deep Learning by diving into its real-world applications.

  <h3><strong><u>Activity: Deep Learning for Mental Health Diagnosis</u></strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> One emerging application of deep learning is its use in diagnosing mental health conditions through voice analysis. AI-powered tools can now detect signs of depression, anxiety, or PTSD based on tone, pitch, speech patterns, and hesitation frequency during spoken conversations.</p>

  <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> These systems use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers trained on labeled datasets containing speech samples from both healthy individuals and patients with diagnosed mental conditions. The models learn to identify subtle speech anomalies linked to specific mental states.</p>

  <p><strong>Socio-Technical Impact:</strong> This technology has strong potential for early detection and intervention, particularly in underserved areas. However, it also raises critical concerns around <em>privacy, consent, data sensitivity, and the potential for algorithmic bias</em>. Ethically, there is a risk of over-reliance on machine judgment without proper clinical validation, and socially, it could impact how employers or insurers perceive individuals flagged by such systems.</p>

  <p>This use case bridges intelligent agent research with real-world impact and shows how ethical foresight is essential in deploying deep learning in sensitive domains.</p>

The discussion focused on key issues including misinformation and deepfakes, which risk distorting reality and causing harm. The conversation highlighted a shared call for improved transparency, detection, and ethical oversight.</p>

  <p>We also examined intellectual property concerns due to AI training datasets containing copyrighted content. This raises unresolved questions about authorship and ownership, necessitating the development of clear legal standards. The risk of job displacement in creative fields was another focus, with both posts emphasizing the importance of preserving human creative roles alongside AI advancement.</p>

  <p>Finally, concerns over privacy violations from impersonation technologies reinforced the need for regulatory safeguards. Overall, the discussion concluded that while deep learning brings transformative potential, responsible governance is essential to maximize benefits and minimize harm.</p>

    <h2>Reflective Section</h2>
  </header>

  <p><strong>What:</strong> Over the course of the Intelligent Agents module, I developed a deep understanding of how autonomous software entities interact, make decisions, and adapt within dynamic environments. From learning the basics of agent architectures to building systems that involve communication, planning, and reasoning, this module provided both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience. The team project in Unit 6 was a particular highlight, as it gave me the opportunity to apply classroom concepts in a collaborative, real-world development context.</p>

  <p><strong>So What:</strong> This module transformed how I perceive artificial intelligence, shifting my focus from algorithmic automation to autonomous reasoning and interaction. It helped me identify the practical challenges of building intelligent systems that must operate in partially observable environments and interact with other agents. I also realized how critical ethical awareness is, especially when agents deal with sensitive data, make autonomous decisions, or collaborate with humans. Most importantly, I gained confidence in using agent-based concepts in real-life domains such as education, mental health support, and organizational consulting.</p>

  <p><strong>Now What:</strong> Going forward, I plan to integrate agent-based computing into my work in educational leadership and AI. I see great potential in developing intelligent tutoring systems that adapt to student behavior and performance using rule-based and learning agents. I also hope to explore using multi-agent simulations for policy testing and stakeholder modeling in academic governance. The skills I gained—designing agent communication, evaluating hybrid models, and considering socio-technical impacts—will serve me well in research and in the design of future AI-enabled platforms like “Rasekhon.”</p>

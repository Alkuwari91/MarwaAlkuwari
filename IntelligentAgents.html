  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
    <p>Welcome to Week 1. We will be setting the agenda by looking at the trends in computing that have led to the rise of agent-based computing. We will also introduce the concept of an agent, what it is, and why they have gained popularity across a breadth of sectors and applications.</p>
    <p>This week’s lecturecast will focus on the drivers of growth of intelligent computing with a specific focus on agent-based approaches. It will discuss what it means for a computer program to be autonomous, and why that is relevant in today’s technological landscape.</p>

    <h3><u>Collaborative Discussion 1: Agent-Based Systems</u></h3>
    <h4><u>Summary of Initial Post by Marwa Alkuwari</u></h4>
    <p>Marwa highlighted that the rise of agent-based systems (ABS) stems from the growing complexity of modern problems and the limitations of centralized approaches. With advancements in AI and distributed computing, ABS—comprising autonomous agents—offer scalable, adaptive solutions. Key enablers include IoT, cloud computing, multi-agent system research, and sectoral needs for real-time adaptability. Industries like healthcare and logistics benefit through improved efficiency and simulation capabilities (Wooldridge, 2009; Jennings, 1998; Bonabeau, 2002).</p>

    <h4><u>Peer Response by Noora Alboinin</u></h4>
    <p>Noora reinforced the strengths of ABS, especially in modelling complex systems via emergent behavior. She noted their relevance in urban planning and finance while also raising concerns around governance, execution complexity, and ethical issues. She stressed the importance of legal frameworks and supervision (Bonabeau, 2002).</p>

    <h4><u>Summary Post by Marwa Alkuwari</u></h4>
    <p>In her final reflection, Marwa reiterated that ABS address the shortcomings of centralized systems, offering scalable, autonomous alternatives. She echoed the technological drivers and highlighted their organizational value, such as operational efficiency and simulation power. Marwa also acknowledged Noora’s points on governance challenges and stressed that proper oversight is essential for responsible ABS deployment. Together, these insights show that ABS are transformative tools—if integrated strategically and ethically.</p>

    <h2>Unit 5: Agent Communication</h2>
  </header>

  <h3><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h3>
  <p>Week 5 explored how agents communicate with each other. The lecturecast introduced the theory of language through Speech Act Theory, provided an overview of the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML), and introduced ontologies as a foundation for structured communication between agents.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discussed the theoretical framework of speech acts and their relevance to agent communication.</li>
    <li>Explored the use of ontologies in structuring and interpreting inter-agent messages.</li>
    <li>Introduced agent communication languages with a focus on KQML.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Key Learning</u></strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Understood the role of speech acts in agent interaction and protocol design.</li>
    <li>Developed ontologies for agent knowledge representation and sharing.</li>
    <li>Constructed inter-agent communication protocols using standard agent communication languages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Collaborative Discussion 2: Agent Communication Languages</u></strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Summary of Initial Post by Marwa Alkuwari:</strong> This post compared Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), such as KQML, with traditional method invocation. ACLs were highlighted for their high-level, intent-based communication using performatives, which enables dynamic coordination and knowledge sharing across heterogeneous agents. These capabilities are underpinned by Speech Act Theory and promote semantic-rich interaction, unlike the rigid, syntactic nature of method invocation in languages like Python or Java. However, ACLs also introduce complexity due to the need for shared ontologies and parsing mechanisms. The post concluded that while ACLs are ideal for flexible and distributed systems, method invocation remains efficient for tightly coupled, performance-driven contexts.</p>

    <h2>Unit 7: Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2>
  </header>

  <h3><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></h3>
  <p>Week 7 focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), one of the most dynamic areas in intelligent agent development. The lecturecast discussed the complexities of human language and the challenges it poses for machines. It also introduced a variety of methods and tools used in NLP, demonstrating how intelligent agents can leverage them to interact more naturally with users.</p>

    <li>Explored fundamental concepts and principles behind NLP.</li>
    <li>Discussed various approaches to implementing NLP.</li>
    <li>Investigated available technologies that support NLP development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Key Learning</u></strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluated the inherent difficulties in developing NLP systems.</li>
    <li>Understood the foundational principles and practical tools of NLP technologies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong><u>Collaborative Discussion 2: Agent Communication Languages – Summary Post</u></strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Summary by Marwa Alkuwari:</strong> This post wrapped up the exploration of Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), with a specific focus on KQML. Marwa highlighted the flexibility and semantic richness of KQML through performatives like "tell" and "ask", which make agent intent and context explicit (Finin et al., 1994). These features allow for seamless interoperability between agents, particularly when using standards such as FIPA ACL (De Ridder, 2025). In contrast, method invocation in languages like Java or Python lacks native mechanisms to convey context or purpose, relying instead on hard-coded instructions.</p>

  <p>Despite KQML’s strengths, it brings implementation complexity due to its reliance on shared ontologies and complex parsing mechanisms (Labrou, Finin, & Peng, 1999). Rodrigo supported this by emphasizing KQML's strength in reasoning and dynamic knowledge exchange (Chalupsky et al., 1993; Mayfield et al., 1996). Together, the discussion concluded that while KQML may not match the performance of simpler invocation methods, it plays a valuable role in building intelligent, semantically aware agents.</p>

    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
  </header>

  <p>This module on Intelligent Agents has been a transformative learning experience that allowed me to engage deeply with both theoretical foundations and practical applications of artificial intelligence. From the early exploration of agent-based computing and logic-based systems to more advanced topics such as deep learning and adaptive algorithms, each week brought new insights and challenges that broadened my understanding of intelligent systems.</p>

  <p>I particularly valued the emphasis on real-world relevance—whether through discussions on agent communication protocols like KQML and KIF, or the ethical complexities of deepfake technologies and AI-generated content. These lessons deepened my critical thinking and highlighted the social responsibilities we must uphold as developers and researchers in this field.</p>

  <p>The team project further amplified this learning by enabling collaborative problem-solving. Our multi-agent fitness monitoring system bridged theoretical knowledge with tangible implementation, reinforcing skills in system architecture, security protocols, and agile development. Working with my peers not only honed my technical and project management skills but also highlighted the importance of effective communication, mutual respect, and adaptability in a team setting.</p>

  <p>Through reflective practice, I’ve become more aware of the competencies I’ve developed: analytical thinking, ethical reasoning, technical fluency, and collaboration. I feel better equipped to apply these skills in academic, professional, and real-world AI scenarios. Moving forward, I aim to continue exploring emerging AI trends, contribute to ethically responsible innovation, and pursue further interdisciplinary research opportunities.</p>

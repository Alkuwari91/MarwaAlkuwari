      <h2>Discussion 2: Legal and Ethical views on ANN applications</h2>
      <p>In my initial post, I discussed the integration of AI writers, or "robo-writers," across various industries. I highlighted both the benefits and risks that come with using AI for tasks ranging from administrative documentation to creative writing. According to the *Future of Jobs Report 2023* by the World Economic Forum, 75% of companies plan to adopt AI tools within the next five years, driven by the efficiency and innovation AI brings to different sectors.</p>
      <p>The key benefits I focused on include how AI writers can handle repetitive tasks like generating reports and standard communications, which can free up human employees to focus on more strategic, creative, and analytical roles (Roland Berger, 2017). Additionally, AI can support the creative process by helping with brainstorming, structuring content, and even generating narratives (Li & Liu, 2018). AI is also transforming research, automating literature reviews and summarizing findings, making it a valuable tool for research-heavy industries (Turck, 2020).</p>
      <p>However, I also raised concerns about the risks of relying on AI writers. One of the major risks is the potential for misinformation. AI systems, though advanced, aren't always accurate and may generate content that seems convincing but is factually incorrect, which is particularly dangerous in fields like healthcare or law (Turck, 2020). Another concern I mentioned is the ethical dilemma surrounding authorship and ownership of AI-generated content. The lack of clear guidelines could lead to disputes and challenges regarding who owns the rights to this content (Kubat, 2021). I also expressed concern that relying too heavily on AI for creative tasks might dilute human originality and authenticity (World Economic Forum, 2023).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, while AI writers offer significant benefits in terms of efficiency and support for creativity, it’s important that we carefully manage the associated risks. I believe organizations should establish clear guidelines to ensure ethical use of AI, focusing on transparency, accuracy, and accountability.</p>

      <!-- WHAT: Critical incidents and project outcomes -->
      <section>
        <h3>WHAT: Critical incidents and project outcomes</h3>
        <p>I worked with important machine learning methods during this session and gained hands-on experience in neural networks, clustering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Gaining practical expertise with machine learning algorithms on real-world datasets was the main objective of these exercises. Data preparation was one of the crucial situations I ran into early on. I came across a number of problems when working on a dataset for a machine learning project, such as missing values and outliers, which had a big impact on how well the models I used—like K-means clustering and linear regression—performed. The significance of appropriate data preparation and cleaning, which are essential for guaranteeing precise and trustworthy outcomes in any machine learning work, was highlighted by this circumstance.</p>

        <p>The group project, which involved cooperation with my classmates to apply machine learning techniques to address a real-world problem, was another important component of the program. Early on in the project, our team had trouble communicating and allocating tasks. Roles and responsibilities were unclear, which resulted in inefficiencies and an unequal distribution of the workload. However, the team adjusted by enhancing communication and clearly defining each member's job after considering our development and getting input from tutors. This change was essential to making sure that everyone participated equally in the process and that we finished the project successfully.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- SO WHAT: Interpretation and Analysis -->
      <section>
        <h3>SO WHAT: Interpretation and Analysis</h3>
        <p>I learnt a lot from the difficulties I had with data preprocessing during the project. When I saw how badly prepared data resulted in unsatisfactory model performance, it became evident to me how important high-quality data is to machine learning. Outliers and missing numbers, in particular, can skew the results of even the most advanced algorithms. I learnt from my experience with EDA how important it is to fully examine and comprehend the dataset before using any machine learning models. I was able to better prepare the data for analysis by visualising it, finding trends, and spotting irregularities.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, my practical knowledge of Python tools like Pandas and Matplotlib significantly improved my capacity for data management and cleaning. For example, I applied imputation techniques to address missing data during EDA and eliminated outliers that affected the accuracy of the model. This procedure not only enhanced the K-means clustering algorithm's performance but also gave me more confidence to use these crucial tools in projects in the future.</p>

        <p>The group assignment gave me a great chance to hone my cooperation and teamwork abilities. The difficulties of group work, especially in a virtual environment, were first made evident by our team's difficulties with communication and task distribution. Nevertheless, we were able to reorganise our strategy to more effectively oversee the project after getting input and considering our group dynamics. By instituting frequent check-ins, we enhanced communication and made sure that everyone on the team understood their roles. Because of this adjustment, our workload was more evenly distributed, and we were able to finish the project faster.</p>

        <p>The module discussions on bias in machine learning algorithms were especially instructive in terms of professional and ethical development. I learnt more about the moral dilemmas raised by biassed datasets and how they might result in unfair outcomes—particularly in delicate fields like healthcare or hiring—through case studies and group discussions. As I grew to understand how crucial it is to make sure that models are not only accurate but also equitable and transparent, the ethical implications of machine learning became a major topic of reflection for me. This knowledge will be crucial for my future work, since I plan to pay closer attention to the moral implications of the models I create.</p>

      <!-- NOW WHAT: Applying Knowledge and Next Steps -->
      <section>
        <h3>NOW WHAT: Applying Knowledge and Next Steps</h3>
        <p>My future career development will be greatly impacted by the information and abilities I acquired from this training. My current position and future professional goals will benefit greatly from my technical machine learning skills, especially in data preprocessing, model evaluation, and using Python libraries. The significance of meticulous data preparation and cleansing is one of the main lessons I learnt from this program, and I will keep using it in my professional job. My comprehension of how EDA and data wrangling can greatly increase the precision and dependability of machine learning models has much improved, and I intend to apply these techniques in all upcoming projects.</p>

        <p>I also intend to investigate more sophisticated machine learning methods, such as neural networks and deep learning models, in order to expand on the fundamental information I acquired in this session. Although I only completed the course's introductory activities, I am excited to learn more about neural networks. I really want to investigate how neural networks can be used to solve practical issues like commercial customer behaviour research or predictive maintenance in industrial settings.</p>

        <p>I learnt a lot about cooperation and project management from my experience working in a team on the project. I will take more care to create clear lines of communication and make sure that everyone on the team has a clear role in any future projects, whether they are academic or professional. Our project benefited greatly from the use of frequent progress reports and explicit task distribution, and I want to implement these techniques in subsequent group projects. The value of flexibility and adaptability in teamwork has also been emphasised by this experience, since any collaborative project's success depends on the team's capacity to modify plans and strategies when difficulties emerge.</p>

        <p>My future approach to model construction will be influenced by the ethical lessons I've learnt about bias in machine learning. My comprehension of the possible repercussions of biassed data and how it can result in discriminating conclusions has increased. I intend to be more proactive in spotting and resolving bias in datasets and algorithms in my future work. This will entail not just technical fixes, including making sure training data is varied and representative, but also taking into account the models' wider social and ethical ramifications.</p>

        <p>To sum up, this module has been a life-changing experience that has improved my technical proficiency as well as my growth on the personal and professional fronts. A thorough grasp of machine learning methods and their practical applications was made possible by the integration of academic education with hands-on practice. I am eager to use the knowledge I have acquired in next projects and to keep improving my abilities in this field. The principles I learnt from this subject will have a long-lasting effect on my work, whether it is through tackling ethical issues, investigating sophisticated machine learning models, or refining data pretreatment approaches.</p>

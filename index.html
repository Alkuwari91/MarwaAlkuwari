        <h2>Overview of Unit 1</h2>
        <p>This unit introduces the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and its growing impact on various sectors. ML is becoming increasingly integrated into everyday processes, from internet browsing to making financial decisions. The availability of real-time big data allows ML algorithms to learn and make more accurate autonomous decisions. As we explored the past, present, and future of ML, we also discussed the interplay between ML, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and big data analytics. Understanding the role of ML in industry, its associated challenges, and the skills required to work in this field are key objectives of this unit.</p>

        <h2>Discussion: Impact of Industry 4.0 on Healthcare</h2>

        <article>
            <h3>Summary Post</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary of Industry 4.0's Impact on Healthcare</strong></p>
            <p>The discussion on Industry 4.0 highlights the transformative potential of technologies such as AI, IoT, and big data analytics in healthcare. These innovations enhance patient care through personalized medicine, continuous monitoring, telemedicine services, and improved operational efficiency. However, the integration of these technologies also brings challenges, particularly in cybersecurity and system reliability.</p>
            <p>A central example discussed is the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, which disrupted the UK's NHS, causing significant delays in patient care and financial losses. The attack exposed vulnerabilities in outdated systems and highlighted the need for proper patch management and robust cybersecurity protocols. As Yemi Gabriel emphasized, timely security updates and network segmentation could have mitigated the impact of WannaCry. Additionally, phishing awareness through staff training is essential to counter such attacks.</p>
            <p>The discussions underline the need for healthcare organizations to strike a balance between leveraging advanced technologies and maintaining strong security protocols. As Noora Alboinin pointed out, adopting Industry 4.0 requires continuous system updates to sustain patient trust and safety while realizing the full potential of digital healthcare.</p>
            <p>In summary, while Industry 4.0 presents exciting opportunities for healthcare, organizations must also develop proactive cybersecurity cultures, invest in training, and establish recovery plans. This will help manage risks and ensure the continuity and safety of healthcare services in an increasingly digital landscape.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Summary of Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
        <p>In Unit 2, I explored the concept of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is a crucial step in the machine learning process. EDA allows us to understand data through visualization and statistical analysis before diving into modeling. It helps uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the data.</p>
        <p>The seminar and readings introduced key techniques for effective EDA, including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. These visualization tools are instrumental in identifying trends and potential issues such as outliers or missing values. EDA plays a critical role in ensuring the quality of the data before proceeding with more complex analyses.</p>
        <p>Readings from Miroslav's "Introduction to Machine Learning" and articles by Patil and Harmadi emphasized best practices, such as thoroughly investigating variable distributions and ensuring data cleanliness. These steps ensure that the dataset is prepared for future modeling and predictions.</p>

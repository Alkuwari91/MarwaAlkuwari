    <section>
      <h2>WHAT: Critical Incidents and Project Outcomes</h2>
      <p>I concentrated on comprehending and using machine learning techniques during this semester using a variety of projects, such as neural networks, clustering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). One significant event that had a detrimental impact on model performance was during data preprocessing, where outliers and missing values were present. I discovered how important data preparation is to guaranteeing precise forecasts. This experience was especially crucial when using regression and K-means clustering models, where successful results required clean, well-structured data.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there were some initial difficulties with teamwork for the group project, including a lack of clarity in task assignment and communication issues. These problems, however, forced the group to improve its communication techniques and task distribution. These changes enabled us to effectively finish the project and significantly enhanced our teamwork.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>SO WHAT: Interpretation and Analysis</h2>
      <p>Technically speaking, I discovered that the calibre of the dataset has a significant impact on how well machine learning models perform. It became clear how crucial EDA and data cleansing are, especially when it comes to making sure models like regression and K-means clustering generate accurate results. The notion that data wrangling is an essential skill in every machine learning process was reaffirmed by this. These real-world uses improved my knowledge of Python tools like Scikit-learn and Pandas, which will help me prepare and analyse data more effectively in the future.</p>
      <p>The group's early difficulties demonstrated the value of effective communication and task distribution in terms of collaboration. We improved our strategy with input from tutors and peers, making sure that everyone contributed equally. My project management abilities and capacity for productive teamwork have both increased as a result of this experience, which is crucial for future employment.</p>
      <p>In terms of ethics, the curriculum stressed how critical it is to eliminate bias in machine learning models. I became more conscious of how unfair or wrong model outputs can result from biassed data, which has important ethical ramifications in sectors like healthcare and finance. My approach to creating and assessing machine learning models with an emphasis on equity and openness has been impacted by this insight.</p>

      <h2>NOW WHAT: Applying Knowledge and Next Steps</h2>
      <p>I intend to keep using the technical and teamwork abilities I have acquired throughout this module. I will be able to analyse business data and produce insights in my professional job thanks to the data pretreatment methods and model evaluation procedures I learnt. Building on the knowledge I acquired in this session, I also plan to investigate neural networks and deep learning models in more detail.</p>
      <p>Applying the knowledge I've gained about project management and teamwork, I'll make sure that future projects in collaborative settings have clearer communication and task distribution. I've learnt from the experience to approach group projects with greater organisation and structure, which will help me in work settings.</p>
      <p>Lastly, I'm determined to keep an eye on moral machine learning techniques, especially when it comes to reducing model bias. My research into creating more equitable algorithms that can be used responsibly across a range of businesses has increased as a result of this module.</p>

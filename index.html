        <h1>Units 2 and 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation, and Regression</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Summary of Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
        <p>In Unit 2, I explored the concept of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is a crucial step in the machine learning process. EDA allows us to understand data through visualization and statistical analysis before diving into modeling. It helps uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the data.</p>
        <p>The seminar and readings introduced key techniques for effective EDA, including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. These visualization tools are instrumental in identifying trends and potential issues such as outliers or missing values. EDA plays a critical role in ensuring the quality of the data before proceeding with more complex analyses.</p>
        <p>Readings from Miroslav's "Introduction to Machine Learning" and articles by Patil and Harmadi emphasized best practices, such as thoroughly investigating variable distributions and ensuring data cleanliness. These steps ensure that the dataset is prepared for future modeling and predictions.</p>

        <h1>Unit 3: Correlation and Regression</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Summary of Unit 3: Correlation and Regression</h2>
        <p>Unit 3 focused on the statistical concepts of correlation and regression. Correlation measures the strength and type of relationship between two variables, with methods such as Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. Regression, on the other hand, models this relationship as an equation that can predict outcomes based on independent variables.</p>
        <p>During the lectures and reading sessions, I learned how to compute correlation and regression, as well as their real-world applications. Regression analysis is particularly useful for making predictions and understanding the dependencies between variables, which can guide decision-making processes in various fields.</p>
        <p>The practical application of correlation and regression in this unit has given me the skills to not only understand theoretical concepts but also apply them to data sets for predictive modeling.</p>
